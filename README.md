Use the arrow keys to move. At any time, press Alt+f4 to quit the game. To attack enemies, press the arrow key in the direction of the enemy when standing next to them.

The goal of the game is to explore as many levels as possible before being killed by an enemy. Each room in each level will have a random number of enemies in it, and that number can increase as levels increase. When you kill an enemy, they will drop an item that the character will pick up, showing its effect at the bottom of the screen. The items can replenish lost health, increase damage done by the player, or increase the distance of the player's field of view/light. The game is over when the player health drops to 0.
